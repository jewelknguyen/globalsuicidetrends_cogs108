       "###Background\n",
       "\n",
       "The increase of suicide rates has become a major health problem throughout various parts of the world. It is important to understand how the rates differ from countries, age and gender and if these patterns are influenced by factors such as culture, mental health support/accessibility, and economic conditions. Over the past 10 years, suicide rates have shown different trends around the world, with a visible drop in high-income countries. Yet with lower and middle income countries high suicide rates remain a struggle. This is likely due to many challenges such as the stigma many cultures have regarding mental health, or certain issues such as poverty.\n",
       "\n",
       "Many studies have shown that generally men, are more likey to die by suicide than women yet women are more likely to have suicidal thoughts and attempts. Age also plays a large factor in this as often times younger individuals are at a high risk of having suicidal thoughts due to the stress of school, work, and social media. Older adults tend to have them due to loneliness or the loss of a loved one. Next, regional differences tend to also play a role in suicide rates. An example being how in many countries women face gender-based violence and social inequality, while men face social expectations and are unwilling to seek help from professionals.\n",
       "\n",
       "The COVID-19 pandemic had played an experimentally large role in the increase and decrease of suidice rates. Many individuals were isolated from others which prompted a slight increase, yet many countries saw a decrease likely due to better mental health programs that were made during the time.\n",
       "\n",
              "### Prior Work\n",
        "\n",
        "Research has shown, overtime suicide rates and demographic disparities in suicide mortality vary. An analysis from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2021 (Yan et al., 2024) provides data on adolescent and young adult suicide mortality from 1990 to 2021 where they found that while global suicide rates have declined overall (AAPC: -1.6%), the rate where there was less suicides depended on what region and socioeconomic status they came from. It was shown that in high income regions there was a slower reductions in suicide mortality while some areas had an increase, particularly for females. Males consistently showed a higher suicide mortality rates than females but the rate of decline for females was more notabl.\n",
        "\n",
        "The findings could conclude an analysis between age period cohort to understand how suicide risk changes across different generations. This study also highlights the challenges to be able to directly  compare between generations, such as changes in mental health awareness, shifts in diagnostic criteria, and differences in how suicides are classified between countries may change the reported suicide rates. Which bring up the issue of underreporting cases, especially in LMIC where suicide deaths are misclassified due to the stigma around mental health.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another study by Lovero et al. (2023) reported on suicide epidemiology within LMIC where they found that suicide rates are lower compared to high income countries (HIC), but reductions in suicide rates was significantly slower. The study highlights that LMIC youth have higher rates of suicide attempts compared to HIC highlighting the importance of mental health care access and suicide prevention. Groups like females, those with psychiatric disorders, LGBTQ+ individuals, and those with lower socioeconomic status are a vulnerable group who are at a higher suicide risks. Additionally, the issues of underreporting, stigma, and limited mental health resources contribute to the inaccuracy in the suicide data, particularly in LMIC making it difficult to develop effective strategies to intervene.\n",
        "\n",
        "Although both studies provide insights on suicide trends they do not fully show the suicide patterns that is happening generationally. Suicide rates among change by economic stability, technological advancements, and changing social attitudes toward mental health, which are not reflected. Additionally, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic remains as mental health stressors like economic instability, social isolation, and healthcare disruptions affect the younger generations.\n",
        "\n",
        "These studies provide an understanding for suicide trends that happened with each generation, with  evolving environments which may effect suicide risk factors. While the GBD study does show a long-term perspective on global suicide mortality, the work by Lovero et al. highlights the challenges faced by LMIC populations where the lack of resources and healthcare contribute greatly towards suicide prevention. This research is to support the need for suicide prevention to take into account for both global and localized factors to receive adequate mental health support. Addressing data collection challenges and identifying the social, economic, and cultural influences behind generational suicide trends will be crucial in getting accessible and helpful resources.\n",

        "We predict that younger generations, Millenials and Generation Z, will have higher rates of suicides compared to older generations. We also predict that male suicide rates will be higher than female. Suicide rates will vary across different regions with higher income countries showing lower suicide rates, while lower and middle income countries will show higher rates of suicide due to limited mental health resources, cultural stigma, and socioeconomic status. We think that countries with a higher GDP will have lower rates of suicide, while countries with a lower GDP will have higher rates of suicide. Furthermore, we predict that suicide rates will be high during the peak of the covid-19 pandemic due to limited mental health resources.\n",

High income countries tend to have more accessible systems regarding mental health for their residents, while lower and middle income countries lack this accessibility due to economic status regarding funding and cultural stigmas about mental illnesses. The COVID-19 pandemic saw a decrease in suicidal rates, because of many countries helping their residents during that vulnerable time. However, some also saw an increase as many countries had issues providing mental health resources. \n",

The data shows no strong linear correlation, as suicide rates vary widely across different GDP levels. However, countries with lower GDP per capita generally have more variation in suicide rates, with some extreme outliers showing very high suicide rates. High-GDP countries tend to cluster at lower suicide rates, but there are still exceptions. This suggests that while economic factors may influence suicide risk, other social, cultural, and mental health factors likely play significant roles.\n"

        "There are many factors regarding ethics and privacy when it comes to speaking about suicide as it is a sensive topic for many, and so the data must be handled with care and respect. The study uses anonymity to protect individuals privacy, but biases might arise in regions where suicide rates are commonly reported or misclassified due to cultural stigmas and limited mental health resources in said region. Ethical concerns include potential misinterpretations of sensitive data and the possible risk of stigmatizing certain areas. Privacy concerns lie in the public availability of the data being shown where personal exposure is slightly at risk, even in an anonymous report.\n",
        "### Biases\n",
        "Potential biases in this dataset can arise in many different forms primarily with the regions from where the data is collected, how the data was classified, and how certain groups (age and gender) are represented. Additionally, cultural and socioeconomic factors may lead to biased data collection as well. An example for this being that gender biases could play a factor in possible underreporting of female suicides, while cultural expectations might cause misreportings of suicides as other causes of death. To handle these concerns, the research team will take several steps to detect potential biases throughout the research process and emphasize the limitations of the data to ensure avoiding making unsupported claims. To help address these issues, this study primarily focuses on anonymized and aggregated data in order to minimize possible risks of exposing personal or sensitive information.\n",

        "### Conclusion\n",
        "This study aims to provide valuable insights into suicide trends while upholding ethical integrity, privacy considerations, and fairness. Acknowledging and addressing biases in the dataset and ensuring responsible interpretation will help mitigate the risks of misrepresentation and contribute to equitable and effective suicide prevention efforts.\n"
