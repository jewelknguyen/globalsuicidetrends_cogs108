Variables measured will include political affiliation (e.g., liberal, conservative, moderate), match rates, user preferences, and demographic factors.

       "\n",
       "In recent years, many young adults have turned to online dating apps to find relationships. Although characteristics such as age and income are factors in dating success, emerging trends suggest that political alignment now plays a significant role in shaping dating preferences for recent generation. As political polarization rises, sharing political views may be a key element in relationship compatibility. This study explores how political views, in addition to age and gender, influence match success for young adults. We hypothesize that aligning politically with a partner may be a significant factor in determining relationship compatibility.\n",

       "The initial study we looked at was conducted in June 2024, titled 'Predict Online Dating Matches Database' <a name='cite_ref-1'></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1). This study predicted online dating matches focusing on: gender, membership status, income, number of children, age, attractiveness ratings, and match count. Although this study identified patterns in the success rate of matches, we wanted to consider political alignment as a variable, as politics for young adults is becoming increasingly relevant in modern dating. \n",
       "\n",
       "Looking deeper into the significance of political views and compatibility, research titled 'Political Party Identification and Romantic Relationship Quality' from 2021 stated that there is a likelier chance of those who identify as Republican to be compatible and adjust to their partners than those who identify as Democratic <a name='cite_ref-2'></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2).\n",
       "\n",
       "This suggests how relevant political beliefs plays a role in determining compatibility and relationship sucess. However, there are few studies have examined the impact of political affiliation on online dating success. This research looks into how political alignment affects match success in online dating among young adults aged 20-30.\n",
