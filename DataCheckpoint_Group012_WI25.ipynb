       "###Background\n",
       "\n",
       "In the digital age, online dating apps have become a primary medium for forming romantic connections, especially among young adults. While traditional factors like age and income continue to play pivotal roles in dating success, the increasing political polarization in society has introduced a new dynamic into the dating scene. Political alignment is becoming a crucial factor in relationship compatibility, reflecting broader societal trends. This study aims to delve into the impact of political views on match success among young adults, hypothesizing that a shared political ideology may significantly influence relationship formation and stability. One's political affiliation may not only impact their match rates but could also potentially influence stability of relationships formed through online dating platforms. With political affilication being an increasingly significant impact in the dating lives of 20-30 year olds, many dating platforms have began catering to specific political preferences. The question lies on if a shared political ideology hinders or enchances the likeliness of forming connections.\n",
       "\n",
       "###Prior Work\n",
       "The initial study we reviewed was conducted in June 2024, titled â€˜Predict Online Dating Matches Database <a name='cite_ref-1'></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1). This study predicted online dating matches focusing on variables such as gender, membership status, income, number of children, age, attractiveness ratings, and match count. Although it identified patterns in the success rate of matches, it did not consider political alignment as a variable, a factor that is becoming increasingly relevant in modern dating among young adults.\n",
       "\n",
       "Delving deeper into the significance of political views and compatibility, research titled 'Political Party Identification and Romantic Relationship Quality' from 2021 demonstrated that individuals identifying as Republicans are more likely to adjust and be compatible with their partners than those identifying as Democrats. This underscores the increasing importance of political beliefs in determining compatibility and relationship success <a name='cite_ref-2'></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2).\n",
       "\n",
       "However, few studies have examined the impact of political affiliation on online dating success specifically. Our research seeks to fill this gap by investigating how political alignment affects match success in online dating among young adults aged 20-30. By doing so, we aim to add a crucial layer of understanding to the complex dynamics of relationship formation in a politically polarized environment.\n",

    "- **Dataset #1: Tinder Millennial Match Rate - EDA & Hypothesis Test**\n",
    "  - **Description:** This dataset provides insights into how millennials are engaging with Tinder, focusing on match rates from various universities. Key variables include ID (unique identifier for each user), Segment Type (mode of Tinder usage), Segment Description (university name), Answer (Tinder usage confirmation), Count (number of matches), Percentage (% of matches), and It became a Relationship (outcome of matches).\n",
    "  - **Preparation Steps:** Convert the 'It became a Relationship' column to boolean values, handle potential outliers in the 'Count' and 'Percentage' columns, and standardize university names for consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dataset #2: Data and Materials for \"The influence of algorithms on political and dating decisions\"**\n",
    "  - **Description:** This dataset examines the effects of AI algorithms on decision-making in political and dating contexts. Important variables are Experiment Type (context of the decision), Persuasion Type (explicit or covert), and Decision Outcome (effectiveness of the persuasion).\n",
    "  - **Preparation Steps:** Encode categorical data such as 'Persuasion Type', check for and handle missing values, and normalize 'Decision Outcome' across different scales for comparative analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dataset #3: Online Dating Behavior**\n",
    "  - **Description:** This dataset delves into factors influencing match success on dating platforms, with variables like Gender, PurchasedVIP (whether VIP service was purchased), Income, Children, Age, Attractiveness, and Matches.\n",
    "  - **Preparation Steps:** Ensure categorical variables are properly encoded, handle outliers in 'Income' and 'Attractiveness', and potentially create new features such as age groups or income brackets for more detailed analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Combining Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "To effectively combine these datasets for a comprehensive analysis, we focus on aligning key variables that are common across the datasets, particularly demographic and behavioral data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This involves:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Standardizing identifiers such as age and gender across the Tinder Millennial Match Rate and Online Dating Behavior datasets, allowing for cross-analysis of user engagement metrics and match outcomes across different dating platforms.\n",
    "- Integrating findings from the Influence of Algorithms on Decisions dataset by correlating algorithmic persuasion types with user behaviors and outcomes observed in the dating datasets. This linkage explores whether there's a correlation between the effectiveness of algorithmic persuasion and user interaction outcomes on dating platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "By consolidating these datasets through shared demographic information and behavioral responses, we aim to derive a more nuanced understanding of how algorithms influence user choices in online dating environments and the broader implications for digital matchmaking efficacy. This merged dataset will serve as a robust basis for examining the interplay between user characteristics, platform interaction, and algorithmic influence in shaping relationship dynamics."
